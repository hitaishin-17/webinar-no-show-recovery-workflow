# 🌀 Grovista Re-Engage Loop (Webinar Replay Automation)

**Built on GoHighLevel (GHL)**  
**Goal:** Rescue webinar no-shows with automated replay workflows and smart lead scoring.

---

## 🔍 Problem

Only 9 out of 50 registrants showed up live.  
But instead of losing the other 41... we turned them into **7 demo bookings** and **2 new customers** – fully automated.

---

## 💡 Solution: The Re-Engage Loop

This project captures and nurtures **no-shows** with:

1. **Multi-channel reminders**  
   Smart WhatsApp + SMS + Email + AI voice nudges, escalated by response tracking.

2. **Instant Replay Distribution**  
   Auto-sent within 15 minutes post-event with a “Book Demo” CTA.

3. **Replay Engagement Scoring**  
   Tag-based scoring to surface high-intent leads.

4. **Lead Routing & Follow-up**  
   🔥 leads → sales task created  
   🧊 leads → moved to nurture
