**üß† Why This Matters**

- **Webinar show-up rates average just 30%**  
  This workflow is designed to **recover pipeline value from the 70% who don‚Äôt attend** by using replays, smart tags, and scoring.
  
- **Automation saves sales time**  
  No manual follow-up needed. Only üî•-scored leads are handed off to sales ‚Äî reducing noise and boosting conversion.

- **Smart segmentation & lead scoring**  
  Every lead is scored based on **behavioral signals** like email opens, video watch %, and CTA clicks ‚Äî not just form fills.
