Webinar Funnel: Re-Engage Loop Workflow Summary

This project demonstrates a fully automated post-webinar re-engagement system designed to recover missed opportunities from no-shows and convert them into high-intent leads using multi-channel follow-ups and lead scoring logic.

üß≠ Workflow Overview
	1.	Registration Form
	‚Ä¢	Trigger: User fills out the webinar registration form.
	‚Ä¢	Tag applied: webinar-registered.
	2.	Smart Reminder Flow
	‚Ä¢	Channels: WhatsApp, Email, SMS, and 30-second AI Voice Drop (1 hour before event).
	‚Ä¢	Escalates if no RSVP or interaction is detected.
	3.	Webinar Event
	‚Ä¢	Attendees tagged with attended-webinar.
	‚Ä¢	No-shows tagged with webinar-no-show.
	4.	Replay Engagement Loop (triggered for no-shows only)
	‚Ä¢	Replay Sent: Within 15 min of webinar ending, replay link sent.
	‚Ä¢	Replay Email Opened ‚Üí opened-replay-email tag, +5 points, wait 24h then check CTA.
	‚Ä¢	Replay Watched 50%+ ‚Üí watched-replay tag, +10 points, CTA fired.
	‚Ä¢	CTA Clicked ‚Üí clicked-demo-link tag, +20 points, task created for sales.
	‚Ä¢	No Engagement After 48h ‚Üí cold-no-show tag, -10 points, sent to nurture drip.
	5.	Demo Booking Trigger
	‚Ä¢	If engagement score > threshold (e.g. 25), lead becomes an SQL.
	‚Ä¢	Tag: sql-ready, passed to sales with priority flag.

üß† Why This Matters
	‚Ä¢	Webinar show-up rates average just 30%. This workflow recovers value from the 70% who don‚Äôt attend.
	‚Ä¢	Automation saves sales time. No manual chasing ‚Äî only üî• leads are passed.
	‚Ä¢	Smart segmentation & scoring. Based on behavior, not just registration.
