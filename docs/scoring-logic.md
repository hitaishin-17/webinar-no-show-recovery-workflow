Replay Engagement Scoring Logic

This document outlines the lead scoring system used in the Webinar Re-Engage Loop to qualify replay viewers and route only high-intent leads to the sales team.

# 📊 Scoring Triggers

| **Trigger Event**            | **Tag Applied**       | **Points** | **Next Action**                         |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|-----------:|------------------------------------------|
| Replay Email Opened         | `opened-replay-email` | +5         | Wait 24h → Check if CTA clicked          |
| Replay Watched 50%+         | `watched-replay`      | +10        | Trigger Demo CTA                         |
| Clicked “Book Demo” CTA     | `clicked-demo-link`   | +20        | Create Task for Sales                    |
| No Engagement After 48h     | `cold-no-show`        | -10        | Move to Nurture Workflow                 |

# 🎯 Lead Stage Scoring Logic

| **Score Range** | **Lead Stage**             | **Action**                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 25+             | SQL (Sales Qualified Lead) | Hand off to Sales team with `sql-ready` tag     |
| 10–24           | Warm Lead                  | Add to retargeting/remarketing list             |
| <10             | Cold Lead                  | Enroll into nurture campaign                    |

System Behavior
	•	Only SQLs are routed to Sales.
	•	Task creation includes context (e.g., last action, tags).
	•	Leads below SQL threshold remain in the marketing-owned funnel.
	•	Nurture tracks re-score leads over time based on future activity.
